    <h1>Blockchain</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>A<b> blockchain</b> is a type of  that consists of growing list of , called blocks<sup>[1][2][3][4]</sup> that are securely linked together using . Each block contains a  of the previous block, a , and transaction data (generally represented as a , where  are represented by leaves). The timestamp proves that the transaction data existed when the block was created. Since each block contains information about the previous block, they effectively form a chain (compare  data structure), with each additional block linking to the ones before it. Consequently, blockchain transactions are irreversible in that, once they are recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks.</p>
     <p>Blockchains are typically <del>stupid</del> managed by a  computer network for use as a public , where nodes collectively adhere to a   to add and validate new transaction blocks. Although blockchain records are not unalterable, since  are possible, blockchains may be considered  and exemplify a distributed computing system with high .</p>
     <p>A blockchain was created by a person (or group of people) using the name (or )  in 2008 to serve as the public  for   transactions, based on previous work by , , and . The implementation of the blockchain within bitcoin made it the first digital currency to solve the  problem without the need of a trusted authority or central . The  design has inspired other applications and blockchains that are readable by the public and are widely used by . The blockchain may be considered a type of .</p>
     <p>Private blockchains have been <strong>okbro</strong> for business use. <i>Computerworld</i> called the marketing of such privatized blockchains without a proper security model ""; however, others have argued that permissioned blockchains, if carefully designed, may be more decentralized and therefore more secure in practice than permissionless ones.</p>
     <p>Cryptographer  first proposed a <small>oyeah</small> protocol in his 1982 dissertation "Computer Systems Established, Maintained, and Trusted by Mutually Suspicious Groups." Further work on a cryptographically secured chain of blocks was described in 1991 by  and . They wanted to implement a system wherein document timestamps could not be tampered with. In 1992, Haber, Stornetta, and  incorporated  into the design, which improved its efficiency by allowing several document certificates to be collected into one block. Under their company Surety, their document certificate hashes have been published in  every week since 1995.</p>
     <p>The first decentralized blockchain was conceptualized by a person (or group of people) known as  in 2008. Nakamoto improved the design in an important way using a -like method to  blocks without requiring them to be signed by a trusted party and introducing a difficulty parameter to stabilize the rate at which blocks are added to the chain. The design was implemented the following year by Nakamoto as a core component of the cryptocurrency , where it serves as the public  for all transactions on the network.<sup>[13]</sup></p>
     <p>In August 2014, the bitcoin blockchain file size, containing records of all transactions that have occurred on the network, reached 20 GB (). In January 2015, the size had grown to almost 30 GB, and from January 2016 to January 2017, the bitcoin blockchain grew from 50 GB to 100 GB in size. The ledger size had exceeded 200 GB by early 2020<sup>[16]</sup>.</p>
     <p>The words block and chain were used separately in Satoshi Nakamoto's original paper, but were eventually popularized as a single word, blockchain, by 2016.</p>
     <p>According to , an <mark>fuck</mark> application of the  theory suggests that blockchains attained a 13.5% adoption rate within financial services in 2016, therefore reaching the ' phase. Industry trade groups joined to create the Global Blockchain Forum in 2016, an initiative of the .

       <br> In May 2018,  found that only 1% of  indicated any kind of blockchain adoption within their organisations, and only 8% of CIOs were in the short-term "planning or [looking at] active experimentation with blockchain". For the year 2019 Gartner reported 5% of CIOs believed blockchain technology was a 'game-changer' for their business<sup>[11]</sup>.</p>
